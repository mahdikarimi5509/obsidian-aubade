**Aubade** is a retro-brutalist theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It prioritises strict geometry, high contrast, and tactile interactions over soft gradients and rounded corners. Designed for users who require their digital workspace to feel like a structural tool.

## Visual Identity

* **Strict Geometry:** A zero-radius policy applied globally. Every corner is sharp; every container is a box.
* **Tactile Feedback:** Buttons and interactive elements feature hard, directional shadows (4px offset) that flatten physically when pressed.
* **High Contrast Borders:** 2px thick borders define every UI element, ensuring clear separation between panes, notes, and metadata.
* **Retro Typography:** Defaults to `Space Mono` for UI and `Azeret Mono` for text, reinforcing the terminal/typewriter aesthetic.

## Colour Schemes

### Dark Mode (Gunmetal)
A deep, low-contrast slate palette (`#303841` base) with monochrome accents and high-visibility text.

### Light Mode (Ice & Steel)
A cool, blue-grey palette (`#DDE6ED` base) offering a clean, architectural look reminiscent of blueprint paper.

## Key Features

* **Dashboard Ready:** Built-in grid support for dashboard layouts, automatically handling column breaks and gap spacing.
* **Mobile Optimised:** Features a custom bottom navigation bar, neutralised animations for better performance, and enlarged touch targets.
* **Nuclear Anti-Roundness:** Specific overrides ensure no plugin or native element introduces rounded corners.
* **Striped Headers:** Windows 95-style pinstripe gradients on window titles and tab containers.
